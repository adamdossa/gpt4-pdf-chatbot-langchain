The Developer Portal is the perfect place to start discovering the Polymesh universe.

Polymesh is an institutional-grade permissioned blockchain built specifically for regulated assets. It streamlines antiquated processes and opens the door to new financial instruments by solving regulatory challenges with public infrastructure around identity, compliance, confidentiality, and governance through key design principles built into the base layer of the chain, rather than as external add-ons.

When it comes to creating and managing digital securities, Polymesh's specificity gives it (and the applications built on it) a distinct advantage over those leveraging general-purpose blockchains. The purpose-built infrastructure addresses the gaps in Ethereum's architecture to align the functioning of the blockchain with the requirements of modern capital markets.

Start with the Introduction to understand Polymeshâ€™s unique solution for regulated securities. Install everything you need to get started and dive into specialised user journeys.

Each user journey unfolds in increasing levels of detail:

* An overview that reveals the big picture.
* An introductory exercise so you can see it in action and try it yourself.
* A developer exercise that reveals the depth and breadth of what you build and how you can integrate it into your existing business processes and systems.
* Links to detailed reference documentation so you can decide how deep you want to go.

The menu on the left organises the content and the exercises in the suggested chronological order for those who wish to thoroughly explore everything this portal has to offer and complete all of the suggested exercises.
