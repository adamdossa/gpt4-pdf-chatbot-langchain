## Quiz 1 - Introduction to Polymesh

1. What is the main difference between Polymesh's approach and that of a general-purpose blockchain, such as Ethereum?
*Polymesh's design focuses on a precise solution to specific requirements, rather than a generalised solution to abstract requirements.
A general-purpose blockchain is incapable of supporting complex applications.
General-purpose blockchains rely on economic incentives to reach consensus but Polymesh usage is free to members.
General-purpose blockchains are computing platforms whereas Polymesh is a securities exchange.

2. What does hyper-fractional asset ownership mean in the context of security tokens?
Large owners are prevented from amassing controlling interest in the underlying asset.
*They enable greater liquidity through the tokenisation of traditionally illiquid assets, opening up access to a global pool of investors through new asset classes for assets that were previously indivisible.
It is a marketing phrase to differentiate digital securities from traditional securities.
It means that assets can be lent out with only a fraction of the underlying asset in reserve.

3. Who can run a Polymesh node?
*Anyone can run a regular node, as well as check the upholding of network rules and the public state secured by the blockchain, but only specific entities (operators) can run nodes that author new blocks or vote on block finality.
Anyone can run a regular node, but only specific entities can check the upholding of network rules and the public state secured by the blockchain. Further, only specific entities can run nodes that author new blocks or vote on block finality.
Anyone can run a node, observe the state, verify that the network is processing according to the rules and propose new blocks.
Anyone can run a regular node, check the upholding of network rules and the public state secured by the blockchain, and run nodes that author new blocks or vote on block finality.

4. Can asset holders use multiple accounts on Polymesh?
*Yes, but their control of multiple accounts holding the same asset is identified by the Polymesh Unique ID system which helps prevent Sybil attacks.
Yes, users use different accounts for every asset and interaction to safeguard anonymity on the network.
No, only one account is allowed per asset holder, which is ensured through the Polymesh Unique ID.
