Most users who simply want to connect to the main network will only need the **Polymesh Wallet**, which is a Google Chrome extension. Polymesh is designed to integrate with legacy systems and business processes through a local node using the SDK.

## Polymesh Wallet

A blockchain wallet is mainly a datastore that holds unique identifiers and public/private keypairs and it is the usual method a user uses to sign and broadcast a transaction.

## Local node and SDK

The SDK presents an API that will feel familiar to most developers. SDK methods address high-level concerns using flows that unburden developers from the underlying blockchain processes. Most businesses running integrations will run one of more local nodes connected to the Polymesh Mainnet, and one or more in-house applications that communicate with their local nodes through the SDK.
